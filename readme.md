You can use cargo to run a specific day (or all DAYS):

```shell
# Run a specific day:
cargo run -- 1
# Run the latest day:
cargo run -- 0
# Run all DAYS:
cargo run -- a
# Get a text prompt to specify a day:
cargo run 
```

Make sure to download your puzzle inputs and put them in the `static` folder, named `input01.txt` (for day 1, for example).
